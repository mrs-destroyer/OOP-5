# Modules in Python
Modules are simply files with the “. py” extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program. We can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions that we want to include in your application.

# Introduction of Modules
Modules typically begin with an overview that introduces module topics, learning objectives, and learning activities.

# Python Urllib Module

# pprint
The pprint function is part of the pprint module. It takes a Python object (like our dictionary) as an argument and produces a string as output. It organizes the data in a way that's easier to read and understand.

# Timit function
Timeit is a module in the Python standard library that provides various functions for measuring the execution times of small portions of code.

# Import module
The Import-Module cmdlet adds one or more modules to the current session. Starting in PowerShell 3.0, installed modules are automatically imported to the session when we use any commands or providers in the module. However, We can still use the Import-Module command to import a module.
